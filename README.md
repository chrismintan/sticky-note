# Sticky Notes
[**Sticky Notes**](https://chrismintan.github.io/sticky-note/) as the name suggests, is a note keeping application modelled after the Microsoft Windows application of the same name. These sticky notes are persistent in nature meaning that your created notes will be there the next time you open up the app! This app uses HTML5's localStorage feature to store the notes data and your notes will persist as long as your local storage is not cleared!
